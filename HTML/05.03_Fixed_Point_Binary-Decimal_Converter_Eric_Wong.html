				<!-- Explaination:
					The decimal place value of the first bit from left to right is -8. It is intended to represent 8,
					but in a complement (signed) binary, the first bit is multiplied by -1 (which turns into -8), in
					order to represent negative decimal numbers.

					However, the first decimal plae value of the first bit from right to left is 0.0625, which is 1/16,
					and it doubles as we go to the left.
					
					We have to paste it 7 more times because we need 8 bits to represent from -8 to 7.9375

<!--
Notes:
1. When creating button ids use btn to start the id.

2. Use this.id to send the id of the button clicked to a function.
We do this so we can change the button clicked to 1 or 0.

3. When dealing with anything other than number inputs, must use .value, not .valueAsNumber.
document.getElementById('btn128').value * 128

4. There actually 10 inputs:
(the 8 bits (buttons) + decimal number input + another button to convert the decimal number).

Therefore we need to have a way to differentiate between them.
The easiest way is to give the table with the 8 bits an id e.g. tblBinary.
Then use this id to get all the buttons in this id and put them in an array (list).

e.g.
let bits = document.getElementById("tblBinary").getElementsByTagName('input');

We can refer to each button with a loop which goes through each button
(the first one is the bit for 128 and the last one the bit for 1).

e.g.
for (let b of bits){
	if (decNum >= placeVal)
		b.value = 1;
	else
		b.value = 0;
	placeVal /= 2;
}


If we didn't do this then we would have to use 8 different ids to refer to each of these 
8 buttons individually.

As the only other input we need to refer to is the decimal number input then we can just refer to by 
giving it its own unique id.

Suggested max % levels:
100% = works as shown here and all 
some attempt to convert in 1 direction
84% = 1 way conversion only.
94% = 2 way conversion but no & HTML JavaScript code restrictions
